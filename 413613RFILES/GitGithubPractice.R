# Create a Git Repository by using the command git init
# Identify the files in your directory using the command ls -a
# Find out what files are tracked by using the command git status
# (the output should confirm that none of the files are currently
#  tracked)
# Now use the command git add --all to add files to be staged. (Lets add
# the file life_exp_analysis.Rmd)
# Make changes to the existing life_exp_analysis.Rmd file
# Now use the command git --staged to see the changes in the file that
# was staged
# Now use the command git commit -m "add a message" to commit your 
# changes.
# Now go to GitHub and create a repository (github.com)
# Push your commit to github
