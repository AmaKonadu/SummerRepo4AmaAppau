# Use the  R function nrow to confirm that the iris data frame has 150 rows. Then 
# use  and show R code that features a map function to confirm that the iris data
# frame has 150 rows.

# Each column of the iris data frame has a unique number of values or objects. For 
# example the column Sepal.Length has 150 values but 35 of them are unique. Use and
# show R code that features a map function to find the number of unique values or 
# objects for each column of the iris data frame.
