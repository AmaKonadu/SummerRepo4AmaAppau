# Pushing a file to GitHub

# Step 1 
# Create a new repository in Git Hub

# Step 2
# Go to the Bash Terminal (Tools > Terminal > New Terminal)

# Check to see if your Bash default directory is Documents. It should look
# something like this.

12407@DESKTOP-M8SMUFL MINGW64 ~/Documents (master)

# If not, change the directory to Documents with the following command:
#  cd ~/Documents
# press enter

# Step 3
# enter the command :  git init
# press enter

# Step 4
# enter the command  : ls (this will list available files to select from your
# Documents location on your computer. Copy one these files)
# press enter

# Step 5
# enter the command : git add (and then paste the file that you selected) 
# press enter

# Step 6
# enter the command : git commit -m "put a message between the double quotes"
# press enter

# Step 7 At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click to copy 
# the remote repository URL. 
# press enter

# Step 8 Enter:  git remote add <some nickname> <paste the copied URL>
#        (this will set the new remote)
# press enter

# Step 9 Enter: git remote -v  (this will verify the new remote URL) 
# press enter

# Step 10  Enter:  git push -u <nickname> master (this code will push the file
# to Github)
# press enter

# Step 11 Go to Github and locate your file by clicking on the repository.
# (If you do not see your file and all steps were executed correctly, go back 
# to the terminal and execute Step 10 again)
