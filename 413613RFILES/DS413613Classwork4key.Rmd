x <- list(26, 32, 45, 50, 65, 77, 82)
y <- list(30, 43, 50, 58, 62, 71, 88)

#1) For the lists given above, show and use R code (a map function) to iterativley 
#find:
  #a) sums across the two vectors. (Use two methods)

map2_dbl(x,y, sum)
map2_dbl(x,y, `+`)

  #b) the calculation of the square of the x value minus the square root of the y
     #value.
     
map2_dbl(x,y,  ~.x^2 - .y^.5)
  
  #c) the ratio of the common log of the x value to the natural log of the y value.

map2_dbl(x,y, ~log10(.x)/log(.y))



x <- list(2, 4, 5, 9, 1)
y <- list(8, 7, 2, 8, 3)
z <- list(1, 8, 5, 4, 2)

#2) For the lists given above, show and use R code (a map function) to iterativley 
#find the squareof the sums accross the vectors

pmap_dbl(list(x,y,z), function(first, second, third) (first + second + third)^2)

) -> table
table

#3) Using the data table above, use and show R code that will output a statement that
#is descriptive for all rows of the data table.

#The first row is given below.  Your code should produce the other specific rows.

  #John who is Male, has a salary that is 65000 dollars per year.

table %>% 
pmap_chr(~ str_glue("{..1} who is {..2}, has a salary that is {..3} dollars per year"))

#4) Write a nested loop that will produce a 5 by 5 matrix that whose matrix elements
#are sums of the corresponding columns and rows.


z <- matrix( nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
for (m in 1:5) {
  for (n in 1:5) {
    z[m, n] <- (m + n)
