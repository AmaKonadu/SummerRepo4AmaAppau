# 1.a) Use `fread()` and relative paths to load in the 
# `data.table` from college_score.csv.

collegedata <- fread("college_score.csv")
collegedata

#  b) Use and show data.table R coding to determine how
#     to determine how many rows the college_score data
#     has.
collegedata[, .(.N)]

#  c) Use read_csv and relative paths to load in the  
# `data.table` from college_score.csv.
collegedata1 <- read_csv("college_score.csv")

#  d) Use tidyverse coding to determine how many rows the
#     college_score data has.

#2 Use a data.table command to display the structure of
#  the college_score data
str(collegedata)

#3. Use data.table to calculate the median for average
# faculty salaries.

# 4  Use Tidyverse coding to change the levels of the variable
# ICLEVEL. In particular change 1 to OneYear, 2 to TwoYear,
# and 3 to ThreeYear. Select only variables INSTNM, SAT_AVG,
# ADM_RATE, and ICLEVEL
collegedata1%>%

# 5 The data.table representation of your data produced
# by the coding of #4 will show the first five rows and the
# last five rows of the data set.  Use R coding to change
# the output of #4 to data.table output.

# 6 Now use a data.table method to output observational rows
# of the original data set (550 - 555) inclusive.
