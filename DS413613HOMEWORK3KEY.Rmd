# coding answers may vary slightly. If codint is similar
# and the output is correct consider granting full credit

Vector1 <- (c( 10, 19, 121, 83, 63, 7, 77, 61, 51, 97, 
            123, 41))

# 1) For the vector given above, use and show two methods
# of R coding to extract the first element and the last 
# element.  6 points

# method 1

Vector1[c(1,12)]

# method 2 

Vector1[-c(2:11)]


# 2) For the vector given above, use and show two methods 
# of R coding to extract all of the elements that are less
# than 60.           6 points

# possible and suggested methods
# method 1
Vector1[Vector1 < 60]

# method 2
Vector1[!(Vector1 >= 60)]

# method 3
Vector1[c(1,2,6,9,12)]

# 3) For the vector given above, use and show two 
# methods of R coding to extract all numbers that are
# not divisible by 2 or 3.    6 points

# The numbers from the vector are not divisible by 2 or
# the numbers are not divisible by 3  (all numbers !!)

# method 1
Vector1[!(Vector1 %% 2 == 0) | !(Vector1 %% 3 == 0)]

# method 2
Vector1[]



# 4) Use and show two R coding methods to confirm that 
# Vector1 does not have missing values   6 points

# method 1
is.na(Vector1) # confirming that all elements evaluated
               # for missing is FALSE
# method 2
(Vector1[ ]) # confirming every element in Vector1. Note
             # that there are no missing elements

# Use the list above for problems 5 - 7.

myList <- list(TRUE, 12.35, "pear",48, c = 3:8,
               list(23, "team"))
myList     

# (note: it is better to type the list into R studio or
# R markdown. Do not copy and paste)

# 5) For the list given above, use and show R coding to 
#  confirm that “pear” is a character element.  4 points

str(myList)     

# 6) For the list given above, use and show R coding to 
#    extract the first three elements of the list.
#  4 points

myList[1:3]                      

# 7) Use the $ operator to extract the element “pear” 
# from your list. Be sure to use and show required R code
# to produce the requested output.

# students will be expected to assign the character
# element to a variable and then apply $ to the variable.

# 4 points

myList <- list(TRUE, 12.35, k = "pear",48, c = 3:8,
               list(23, "team"))

# 8) Use and show R code to write a function to solve the
# following quadratic equations by using the quadratic 
# formula. (all equations have two real number solutions)

# a) x2 - 3x - 28 = 0 
# b) x2 + x  - 30 = 0  
# c) 3x2+ 14x + 8 = 0 
# d) 2x2+11x = 6

# 7 points

  return(c(answer1 = answer1, answer2 = answer2))

QuadFormula(1,-3,-28)
QuadFormula(1,1,-30)
QuadFormula(3,14,8)
QuadFormula(2,11,-6)


# 9) In your book (towards the end of chapter 16) a 
# special set of vectors are defined as Augmented 
# Vectors.  One such augmented vector is a Tibble. 
# Use and show R code that will produce the Tibble 
# shown below.  Do not simply type or copy and paste. 
# You must show and use R coding that will output the 
# tibble.

#  6 points

# suggested method:

library(tidyverse)

tibble(x = 1:10, y = 10:1, z = .5*y)

# 10 In statistics, the Interquartile Range is the 
# difference between Q3 and Q1.  Now show and use map 
# function coding to find the Interquartile Range for 
# each column of the tibble from number 9.

# suggested solution coding

# 4 points


tibble(x = 1:10, y = 10:1, z = .5*y) -> anyvariable
anyvariable

map_dbl(anyvariable, IQR)
