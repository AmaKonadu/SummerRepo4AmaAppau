			"We thus define the tidy text format as being a table",
  "with one-token-per-row. A token is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word",
  "that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is", 
  "the process of splitting text into tokens. This one-token-per-row",
  "structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored in", 
  "current analyses, perhaps as strings or in a document-term matrix.",
  "For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is",
  "most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or",
  "paragraph. In the tidytext package, we provide functionality to", 
  "tokenize by commonly used units of text like these and convert", 
  "to a one-term-per-row format."

  To whom it may concern,
I had the pleasure of teaching Alexander Zakrzeski the Spring Semester of 2021 and
the summer session of 2021 at American University.  He was my student for the courses
DS 612 R Programing for Data Science and DS 613  R Programing for Data Science in 
sequence.  Although these were very intense programing courses,  Alexander excelled 
in both courses and earned a grade of A in each course.  The topics covered in these 
courses were broad and deep, specifically featuring coverage of Data Visualization, 
Data Transformations, Data Wrangling, Methods for Tidying Data, Webscraping, Shiny 
app development and many other R programing/Data Science topics.   I was especially 
impressed with his ability to learn and grasp difficult procedures quickly and extend
his learning experience so that he could take advantage of R coding explorations and 
applications.  Alexander did not just go through the motions, he exhibited a passion 
for R coding and was always eager to supplement and expand his knowledge base of the 
R language as well as Data Science in general.  Often he would show an interest in 
advanced R programing tasks that required more in depth study and analysis.  I also 
appreciated and respected his willingness to help fellow students with the course work
and always amenable to working collaboratively with classmates. He always submitted 
work professionally and on-time.  Alexander was consistent in both classes with regards
to productivity, punctuality and politeness.
<br>
I highly recommend Alexander for challenging and rewarding opportunities in higher 
education and employment.
