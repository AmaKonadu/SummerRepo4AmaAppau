	#3b  Fertility Rate = 1.378 + 2.734GII  (The equation's slope indicates that for every
	#    index unit of increase for gender inequality, the fertility rate increases by 2.734 on
	#    average)

	#  The low r value indicates that the scatter plot does not show a strong linear relationship
	#  between the varibles

	#  variable is explained by the linear model.
	
	#3d  Based on the quantitave results of #3c, we cannot say with confidence that fertility rate
	#    and gender inequality have a strong linear relationship.
