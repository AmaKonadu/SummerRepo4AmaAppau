# Interpretation: Note that for both levels of the factor Service Center, the posiioning of the
# lines does not change for the levels of the other factor. Top, middle, and bottom does not
# change. The lines do not cross, hence suggesing no interaction.

# The null hypothesis should not be rejected for either individual factor on the basis of the p
