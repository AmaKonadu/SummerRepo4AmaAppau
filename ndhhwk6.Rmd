```{r}
#Instructions:   
# 1)  Execute the following installations (separately and one at a time):
#Enter the r code untidydata and then select language diversity.
#You should produce the following r data call of  

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

untidydata::language_diversity

#2)  The data set is too long (444 rows) and should be wider in order to become 
#more useful and understandable.  Use and show R code to produce a table that is
#wider data table version of the original data table.
#A partial printing of the wider data table is given below:
untidydata::language_diversity%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Measurement, values_from = Value)-> Langdiv
Langdiv

#3)  Now use and show R code that will arrange the Continents in alphabetical
#order.  Print the first 40 rows.  A partial table showing rows 35 â€“ 40 are given below.
Langdiv%>%
  arrange(Continent)%>%
  print(n=40)

#4)  Now use and show R code that will only produce Asian countries in the data 
#table.  There are 16 Asian countries.
Langdiv%>%
  filter(Continent == "Asia")

#5)  Enter the r code untidydata and then select pre_post
#You should produce the following r data call of   untidydata::pre_post
#Produce the pre_post table that shows all 16 rows.
untidydata
untidydata::pre_post

untidydata::pre_post%>%
  print(n=16)

#6) For the pre_post data table, Use and show R code that will eliminate the under
#scores for the variable spec.  A partial table is given below:
untidydata::pre_post -> K
K

K%>%
  mutate(spec = recode(spec, "g1_lo" = "g1lo", "g2_lo" = "g2lo", "g2_hi" = "g2hi", "g1_hi" = "g1hi"))
#7)  Load the given link below and then create an excel file for the covid- 19 
#data that is given.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global. 
#Use and show R code that imports the excel spread sheet into R.  Assign your 
#imported data the variable covid.
read_csv("time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")->covid
covid

#8)  The covid data table is too wide.  Apply and show R tyding code that will
#create a longer data table and then print 25 rows of the new data table.  
#A partial table is given below.
covid%>%
  select(`Province/State`, `Country/Region`, Lat , Long, everything())%>%
  pivot_longer(col = `1/22/2020` :`10/15/2020` , names_to = "Dates", 
               values_to =  "Cases")%>%
  print(n=16)-> covid1
covid1

#9)  Now use and show R code that changes your table from number 8 and will produce 
#a table that only shows data for the countries Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore. 
#When printed, the first ten rows automatically shows data for Singapore.
covid1%>%
  filter(`Country/Region`== c("Vietnam","Thailand","Singapore"))-> covid2
covid2

#10) Now show and use R code to produce the bar graph given below that shows 
#approximate counts for the countries Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore
ggplot(data = covid2, aes(x= `Country/Region`, y = Cases, fill=`Country/Region`))+
  geom_bar(width = .5, stat = "identity")

#11) Now show and use R code that will give accurate counts for Covid-19 cases 
#for all there countries.  (The number of cases for the country of Singapore is
#(2,653,210)
ggplot(data = covid2, aes(x= `Country/Region`, y = Cases, fill=`Country/Region`))+
  geom_bar(width = .5, stat = "identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label = Cases), vjust = 0)
