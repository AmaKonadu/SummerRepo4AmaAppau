"We thus define the tidy text format as being a table",
  "with one-token-per-row. A token is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word",
  "that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is", 
  "the process of splitting text into tokens. This one-token-per-row",
  "structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored in", 
  "current analyses, perhaps as strings or in a document-term matrix.",
  "For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is",
  "most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or",
  "paragraph. In the tidytext package, we provide functionality to", 
  "tokenize by commonly used units of text like these and convert", 
  "to a one-term-per-row format."
