# STAT 412/612 CLASSWORK 1 
# Instructions: Generate an R markdown file and a Word File
# that shows all required R code and output.

# 1) Use and show R code to find the square root of 63,504.

sqrt(63504)
(63504)**.5
# 2) Use and show R code to log10(45000) 

log10(45000)
# 3) Use and show R code to evaluate ln(23.05) 

log(23.05)

# 4) Use and show R code to write all integers from 15 to 1 
# in decreasing order. 

15:1
# 5) Use and show R code to find the mean of all
# prime numbers 3 to 17 inclusive. 

mean(c(3,5,7,11,13,17))

#6) Use and show R code to round 17.3838 to the nearest
# hundredth 

round(17.3838, digits = 2)

# 7) Use and show R code to evaluate the expression 
# 7(53 – 2)2 .

7*(53-2)*2

# 8) Use R code to write a function that will calculate the 
# volume of a cylinder. The following formula will be helpful,
# V = πr 2h.  Then use your function to calculate the volume
# of a cylinder that has a radius of 25 and a height of 10.

volcyl <- function(r,h){
  VC = pi*r*2*h
  return(pi*r*2*h)
}

volcyl(25,10)
